#### Operational Database:
The operational database is built based on the principles of normalization, specifically achieving third normal form (NF3). It serves as the foundation for recording and managing various aspects of medicine sales, including suppliers, medicines, patients, appointments, reports, and more. The database ensures data integrity and supports efficient transaction processing.

#### Tableau Dashboard:
To present the analyzed data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, a dashboard has been developed using Tableau. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, charts, and graphs to summarize and present key metrics and trends. It empowers hospital stakeholders to explore the data, drill down into specific details, and derive actionable insights from the medicine sales data.
