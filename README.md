# West Springfield - Hospital Information System

### Operation Database, Data Warehouse, ETL, Dashboard

#### Project Introduction: West Springfield Hospital Reporting System
Welcome to the West Springfield Hospital Reporting System project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing the sale of medicine at West Springfield Hospital. The system consists of an operational database, a star schema data warehouse, and a dashboard built using Tableau.



#### Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust reporting system that enables efficient management and analysis of medicine sales data at West Springfield Hospital. The system will provide hospital administrators and staff with valuable insights and actionable information to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, sales performance, and overall business operations.

#### Components
The project comprises the following components:

##### Operational Database:
The operational database is built based on the principles of normalization, specifically achieving third normal form (NF3). It serves as the foundation for recording and managing various aspects of medicine sales, including suppliers, medicines, patients, appointments, reports, and more. The database ensures data integrity and supports efficient transaction processing.

##### Star Schema Data Warehouse: 
In addition to the operational database, a star schema data warehouse has been implemented. The data warehouse is designed to support advanced analytics and reporting by providing a denormalized and optimized structure for data analysis. It enables complex queries and aggregations for generating meaningful insights related to medicine orders, sales trends, and performance metrics.

##### Tableau Dashboard:
To present the analyzed data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, a dashboard has been developed using Tableau. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, charts, and graphs to summarize and present key metrics and trends. It empowers hospital stakeholders to explore the data, drill down into specific details, and derive actionable insights from the medicine sales data.
